# VisuaSort

In this application, you can visualize Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, and Bubble Sort! I hope that Computer Science students can use this to aid their learning!

###Background

While studying data structures & algorithms, I found that really understanding what was actually going on under the hood of sorting algorithms was a pain point for many students. Students would spend time reading about them and even implementing them, and they would make sense...for a few days until they forgot about them again. While trying to help someone with Merge Sort, I found myself lapsing in memory of the exact way it works. I figured I needed to review these algorithms and why not do something fun with it while I'm at it? I was able to find visualizers of specific algorithms on YouTube before, but I wanted to make a place where you could actually interact with it and see all 4 in action, not just one!
